# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-CNN---VGG19
Classification of Wearing Mask and Not wearing Mask. [Binary Classification]


Social distancing, also called ‚Äúphysical distancing,‚Äù means keeping a safe space between yourself and other people who are not from your household.

To practice social or physical distancing, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from other people who are not from your household in both indoor and outdoor spaces.

Objective is to build a Deep Learning model which can identify if the person is wearing a mask or not, also detecting if people vilating social distancing norms.


Note : Red box shows violation of social distancing.¬∂


Before you start, Make sure all the requirements are installed and model directory path is given right.

One's Everything is done. 
Step 1 : Run the "face-mask-detection_model_training.ipynb" It will download the trained model called "masknet.h5".

Use trained model to predict in the real time face mask detection.

Step 2 : Make sure model is in right working directory path. 

Step 3 : Run "real_time_face_mask_detect.py" for real time face mask detection using computer vision.

Step 4 : Wear the masküëç and test.

Step 5 : Use "Esc" key to end the detection.
