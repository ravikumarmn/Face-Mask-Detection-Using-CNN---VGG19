Social distancing, also called ‚Äúphysical distancing,‚Äù means keeping a safe space between yourself and other people who are not from your household.
To practice social or physical distancing, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from other people who are not from your household in both indoor and outdoor spaces.
Objective is to build a Deep Learning model which can identify if the person is wearing a mask or not, also detecting if people vilating social distancing norms.


## Note : Red Box Shows Violation of Social Distancing.


Before you start, Make sure all the requirements are installed and model directory path is given right.

One's Everything is done. 
## Step 1 : Run The "face-mask-detection_model_training.ipynb" It Will Train & Download The model("masknet.h5").

Use trained model to predict in the real time face mask detection.

## Step 2 : Make Sure Model Is In Right Working Directory Path. 

## Step 3 : Run "real_time_face_mask_detect.py" For Real Time Face Mask Detection Using Computer Vision(CV).

## Step 4 : Wear The Masküëç And Test.

## Step 5 : Use "Esc" Key To End The Detection.
